# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

## Introduction to data structures and algorithms

Why are algorithms and data structures always interconnected?
They are always interconnected because algorithms process data that is stored in data structures. Basically data structures store the data and the algorithms process this data

## Algorthims

An algorithm is a series of code that do something

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is basically how your code slows as data grows
O(n):
n = how much data you have
O = order of

The other names of Big O:
*complexity
*time complexity
*algorithmic complexity
*asymptotic complexity

## Determining Big-0

1. identify the specific code that you want to work with
2. Identify N-> what is it measuring eg if you have some code that is iterating over all the records in a database , then n is how many records are there in the database or how many beans are in a jar.
3. Count the steps in a typical run
4. keep the most significant part

## The Ssystematic Strategy of Solving Problems

1. State the problem clearly, identify the input and output formats
2. Come up with some example inputs and outputs. Try to cover all edge cases
3. Come up with a correct solution for problem. state it in plain english
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. fix bugs if any
5. Analyze the algorithms complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6
